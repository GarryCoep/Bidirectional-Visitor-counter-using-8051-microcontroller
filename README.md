# Bidirectional-Visitor-counter-using-8051-microcontroller
Microcontroller/Microprocessor is the most versatile device in the world. Itâ€™s once a creature of science fiction is today a reality. In real sense it is a device which allows human beings to implement their intelligence in machines. Visitor counting is simply a measurement of the visitor traffic entering and exiting offices, malls, sports venues, etc. Counting the visitors helps to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of employees, floor area and sales potential of an organization. Visitor counting is not limited to the entry/exit point of a company but has a wide range of applications that provide information to management on the volume and flow of people throughout a location. A primary method for counting the visitors involves hiring human auditors to stand and manually tally the number of visitors who pass by a certain location. But human-based data collection comes at great expense. Here is a low-cost microcontroller-based visitor counter that can be used to know the number of persons at a place. All the components required are readily available in the market and the circuit is easy to build. The result of this project is a thorough design for an autonomous visitor counter including a detailed test plan for the use by subsequent design teams.
